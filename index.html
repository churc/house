        <p>The <a       href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/preventionthroughhealthcare/healthdepartments/commhealthcenters.htm"target=”_blank”New Tab>CDC</a> details what community health centers are:
        Community health centers are community-based and patient-directed organizations that serve populations with limited access to health care. HRSA-supported community health centers must meet the following requirements:
        <ul>
            <li>Located in or serve a high need community (designated Medically Underserved Area or Population).</li>
            <li>Governed by a community board composed of a majority (51% or more) of health center patients who represent the population served.</li> 
            <li>Provide comprehensive primary health care services as well as supportive services (education, translation and transportation, etc.) that promote access to health care.</li>
            <li> Provide services available to all with fees adjusted based on ability to pay.</li>
            <li>Meet other performance and accountability requirements regarding administrative, clinical, and financial operations.</li>
        </ul>
       <p> The 19 program requirements that health centers must meet are  <a href="http://bphc.hrsa.gov/programrequirements/index.html"target=”_blank”New Tab>listed by HRSA</a>
